# PonchOS
PonchOS is a web-based OS inspired by Linux, designed to simulate a virtual machine with a cybersecurity focus. Built with a focus on accessibility and modularity, it uses LocalStorage to host files in a virtual Explorer and organizes applications as standalone pages to keep the codebase lean while delivering powerful features. Each app operates independently but integrates seamlessly within PonchOS for a cohesive user experience, making it an ideal tool for learners and enthusiasts to explore virtual machine management and cybersecurity scenarios.

Features:

Linux-Style Interface: A responsive taskbar with custom SVG icons.
Virtual Explorer: Uses LocalStorage to simulate file hosting and management, mimicking real OS functionality.
VM Monitoring: In Dev
Threat Command Dashboard: Simulates cybersecurity scenarios for hands-on learning.
LineOrca: A network monitoring tool designed to simulate traffic
Modular App Design: Each application (e.g., Threat Command, LineOrca) runs on its own page, ensuring lightweight performance and standalone functionality.
Extensible Framework: Easily add new apps or features without bloating the core OS.

Technologies

HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript: For a responsive and modern front-end.
LocalStorage: Efficient file storage for small files.
